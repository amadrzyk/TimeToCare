## Inspiration

The inspiration for our application stemmed from the desire to solve an issue that we, our friends, and our families have experienced.

## What it does

TimeToCare is a web-based application designed to mitigate the long wait times experienced in hospital ER settings.

## How we built it

We built the components of our app with a few different languages and tools.  They include HTML/CSS to build the framework of our website, Bootstrap as a web template, Javascript for the general functionality of the website, and data from the Google Maps API.

## Challenges we ran into

Challenges in our project mostly arose from the steep learning curve of what was required to build our application.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are very proud to have developed an app that we believe could have a major impact in the health field.  We came to HackWestern with the hope of solving this problem and despite our inexperience with any of the APIs or new languages, we feel like we have accomplished something amazing. Not only that, but we also went home with the "Best Hack to Help Patient Wait Times" award at Hack Western 3!

## What we learned

Including the programs and tools we used to build TimeToCare, we also learned teamwork, the importance of clear communication and good design principles.

## What's next for TimeToCare

Our next step for TimeToCare would be a working build.  Now that we have supported our theory of directing patients to hospitals based on wait times and distance, we would love to see it run using real-time data.  We could see the required data being pulled from a government website or provided by the hospitals directly to the app.
